# StickyNote [UNFINISHED]
A revival of my older project, JustYourDigitalPositIt, using WPF.
This project is only about a year old as of archive date, but it seems like a long time since I've made it.
Since then, I have switched app frameworks.

### This project is unfinished!!!
This project will not be maintained or worked on for the foreseeable future.

### What did I learn on this project?
- This project helped me learn WPF better.
- It helped introduce me to XAML-based application styling and bindings.

## Screenshots of project in its current state
WPF debug tools are present in each photo (the gray handle at top).
